\section{Introduction}
This package adds the input lines of various parts of your LaTeX
document as marginpars.
It can also add the first and last input lines read to the header and
footer respectively.

The marginpars float, and I can't guarantee they'll be entirely
accurate if lots are bunched together.
Also, the begin and end page numbers might not be totally accurate.
But they're still useful (I hope).

The numbers that float with tables and the like do not float, so they
will overlap other numbers in some circumstances.
This should be rare since floats should have their own space.
